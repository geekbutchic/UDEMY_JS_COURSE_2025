# Lesson 7 - INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT

## WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?
* **JavaScript** is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

* **High-Level** : abstracted from hardware, allowing developers to write code without needing to worry about low-level details like memory management or processor instructions.

* **Object-Oriented** : JavaScript supports (oop) paradigm, which organizes code around objects (which are collections of data and functions).

* **Multi-paradigm** : Supports more than one programming style or paradigm.  Such as functional programming, where you focus on writing pure functions and passing around data.

* **Programming language** : JS is a tool used to write code that can be executed by a computer to perform tasks.

# LESSON 9 : VALUES AND VARIABLES

* What is a VALUE : refers to any data or information that can be stored, manipulated, or used by the program.

* CamelCase is widely used in JavaScript, especially for variable and function names, as it's considered readable and helps distinguish different types of identifiers.

* When all uppercase is the commonly accepted naming convention for constant variables in JavaScript.
