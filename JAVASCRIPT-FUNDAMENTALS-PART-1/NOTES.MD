# Lesson 7 - INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT

## WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?
* **JavaScript** is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

* **High-Level** : abstracted from hardware, allowing developers to write code without needing to worry about low-level details like memory management or processor instructions.

* **Object-Oriented** : JavaScript supports (oop) paradigm, which organizes code around objects (which are collections of data and functions).

* **Multi-paradigm** : Supports more than one programming style or paradigm.  Such as functional programming, where you focus on writing pure functions and passing around data.

* **Programming language** : JS is a tool used to write code that can be executed by a computer to perform tasks.

# LESSON 9 : VALUES AND VARIABLES

* What is a VALUE : refers to any data or information that can be stored, manipulated, or used by the program.

* CamelCase is widely used in JavaScript, especially for variable and function names, as it's considered readable and helps distinguish different types of identifiers.

* When all uppercase is the commonly accepted naming convention for constant variables in JavaScript. 

Examples
```
MAX_USERS
PI
API_KEY
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH
```

# LESSON 10 : DATA TYPES

### THE 7 PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
* NUMBER : let age = 23;
* STRING : let firstName = 'Sonny';
* BOOLEAN : let fullAge = true;

* UNDEFINED : let children
* NULL : 'empty value'
* SYMBOL
* BIGINT

Value has a type NOT variable

### COMMENT CODE

command /

MULTI-LINE COMMENT

/* CODE */

DECLARING A NEW VARIABLE

* use let, const or var
* To reassign you don't need a variable name
* JavaScript automatically determines the type based on the value assigned to the variable, and this type can change during the programâ€™s execution.
